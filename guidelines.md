# Community Guidelines

Welcome to TransHarbor! These guidelines help ensure everyone feels safe, respected, and welcome. Please read through these carefully before participating.

**By using TransHarbor, you agree to follow these guidelines and help create a safe, supportive space for trans and nonbinary people.**

## Core Principles

### Trans and Nonbinary Centered
- This platform exists **for and by** trans and nonbinary people
- Allies and supporters are welcome when respectful and supportive
- Trans and nonbinary experiences are centered in all discussions

### Respect and Inclusivity
- **Treat everyone with dignity** regardless of their identity, journey, or background
- **Use preferred names and pronouns** - if you're unsure, just ask politely
- **Respect all trans identities** including binary, non-binary, genderfluid, agender, and questioning individuals
- **Welcome newcomers** and help them feel at home

### Safety First
- **Zero tolerance** for harassment, discrimination, or hate speech
- **No doxxing** or sharing personal information about others
- **Respect privacy** - don't share private conversations elsewhere
- **Report concerns** to moderators immediately via the report system

### Constructive Communication
- **Be kind and supportive** in your interactions
- **Disagree respectfully** when opinions differ
- **Avoid inflammatory topics** that could harm community wellbeing
- **Listen actively** and practice empathy

## Community Expectations

### What We Encourage
- Peer support and encouragement
- Celebrating milestones and achievements
- Sharing helpful resources and experiences
- Authentic self-expression
- Building genuine connections
- Thoughtful discussions about trans and nonbinary issues

### What We Don't Allow
- Any form of transphobia or discrimination
- Harassment, bullying, or targeted attacks
- Unsolicited advice about transition or medical decisions
- Sharing personal information about others
- Spam, advertising, or self-promotion
- Explicit sexual content
- Inflammatory political debates that derail community discussions

## Posts and Personals

### Content Standards
- **Text only** (10-500 characters)
- **Be authentic** - genuine connection is the goal
- **Category appropriately** (friends, community, penpals, other)
- **No spam** - don't post the same thing repeatedly
- **Keep it appropriate** - no explicit content

### Post Etiquette
- Be clear about what you're looking for
- Respect others' boundaries and preferences
- Don't demand responses or attention
- Accept that not everyone will want to connect

## Direct Messaging

### Message Standards
- **Be respectful** in all conversations
- **Respect boundaries** if someone doesn't want to continue talking
- **No harassment** - one response is enough if someone doesn't reply
- **Keep it appropriate** - no unsolicited explicit content
- **Use the block feature** if someone makes you uncomfortable

### Conversation Etiquette
- Introduce yourself when starting a conversation
- Be patient - people may not respond immediately
- Don't pressure anyone to share personal information
- End conversations gracefully if they're not a good fit

## Identity and Expression

### Names and Pronouns
- **Respect chosen names** at all times
- **Use correct pronouns** and apologize briefly if you make mistakes
- **Don't ask about deadnames** or previous identities
- **Support identity exploration** - people can change how they identify

### Transition Discussions
- **Don't assume everyone's goals** are the same
- **Avoid unsolicited medical advice** - everyone's path is different
- **Respect different timelines** - there's no "right" pace
- **Support questioning members** without pressuring labels

## Privacy and Safety

### Personal Information
- **Never share others' personal details** without permission
- **Be cautious about your own privacy** - once shared, information spreads
- **Don't pressure others** to share location, photos, or contact info
- **Use caution** when meeting people from the platform

### Blocking Users
- Use the block feature if someone makes you uncomfortable
- Blocked users cannot see your posts or message you
- You don't need to explain why you blocked someone
- Blocking is a personal safety tool, not a punishment

## Reporting and Moderation

### How to Report
- Use the **Report button** on posts, messages, or profiles
- Select the appropriate reason
- Provide specific details to help moderators
- Reports are reviewed promptly and confidentially

### What to Report
- Harassment or targeted attacks
- Hate speech or discrimination
- Spam or scams
- Threats or violence
- Privacy violations (doxxing)
- Impersonation
- Any violation of these guidelines

### Moderation Process
- Reports are reviewed by moderators
- Evidence is evaluated
- Appropriate action is taken
- Reporters are not notified of outcomes (to prevent gaming the system)
