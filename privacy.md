As a user-owned nonprofit, we have no financial incentive to sell your data. Your data belongs to you, and we only use it to provide and improve TransHarbor.

## Hosting and Jurisdiction

TransHarbor is hosted in the United States and subject to US law. Our infrastructure is managed to ISO 27001 security standards - the same framework banks and hospitals use.

This means US law enforcement with valid warrants can compel us to provide data. We'll fight overbroad requests, but we must comply with valid legal process.

## What We Collect

**You Provide:** Email, username, password (encrypted), optional profile info (display name, bio, pronouns, location), posts, messages, reports, votes

**Automatic:** IP address (security only), device type, app version, login timestamps, error logs

**We Don't Collect:** GPS location, contacts, photos, browsing history, advertising IDs

## How We Use It

* Platform operation and authentication
* Safety, moderation, and abuse prevention
* Account notifications (no marketing emails)
* Bug fixes and improvements

## What's Public

Username, display name, bio, pronouns, location, posts, post count, account creation date, voting member status

## What's Private

Email, password, IP address, direct messages, reports, blocks, individual votes

## We Never Sell Your Data

We don't sell, rent, or share your data with third parties. Ever. Our legal structure prohibits it.

**Limited Disclosure:** Only with your consent, legal requirements (warrants/subpoenas), safety emergencies, or platform protection

## Security

**Encryption:** Passwords hashed with industry-standard encryption, data encrypted at rest, HTTPS/SSL for all connections

**Hardware Security Modules:** Encryption keys stored in YubiHSM tamper-resistant hardware devices, not software

**ISO 27001 Standards:** Infrastructure managed to bank-grade security standards including documented policies, regular audits, incident response protocols, and access controls

**Access Control:** Restricted access to essential personnel only

**Monitoring:** Regular security audits and continuous compliance verification

## Law Enforcement Requests

We're subject to US law and must comply with valid warrants and subpoenas. 

**Our Process:**
- Verify request is valid and properly authorized
- Challenge overbroad or inappropriate requests
- Provide only the minimum data legally required
- Notify affected users when legally permitted

We cannot protect you from valid legal process, but our encryption and hardware security protections ensure unauthorized access is prevented.

## Your Rights

**Access:** View/download your data anytime via Settings or contact support@transharbor.org

**Modify:** Edit profile, posts, messages within limits

**Delete:** Delete individual content or entire account (permanently removed within 30 days)

**Opt-Out:** Disable email notifications and voting reminders in Settings

## Data Retention

* Active accounts: Indefinitely while active
* Deleted accounts: Permanently deleted within 30 days
* Backups: Retained 90 days for disaster recovery, then purged

## Age Requirement

18+ only. We don't knowingly collect data from anyone under 18. If we discover a user is under 18, we'll delete their account immediately.

## Open Source

TransHarbor is open source. You can verify our privacy and security claims by auditing the code. Everything we say here is verifiable.

## Changes

Privacy Policy updates require democratic governance process. Major changes need supermajority approval (2/3 + 30% quorum).

We'll notify users of material changes via email and in-platform notification.

## International Users

If you're outside the United States, your data will be transferred to and processed in the US. By using TransHarbor, you consent to this transfer.

For users in countries where government surveillance of trans people is a concern: we use government-grade security to protect you. Encryption and hardware security modules mean even we can't access your data without physical access to our security hardware.
