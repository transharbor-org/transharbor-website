description: Join TransHarbor's volunteer moderation team to help keep our trans and nonbinary community safe.
---

**TransHarbor needs moderators to help keep our community safe.**

We can't pay you, but we provide detailed letters of recommendation, professional references, and document your contributions. This is real community moderation work that builds skills and protects trans people globally.

## What Moderators Do

**Core work:**
- Review reported content and take action (remove, warn, ban)
- Respond to harassment, doxxing, and safety issues
- Monitor public spaces for violations
- Support users dealing with problems
- Help develop and refine community policies

Moderation isn't just removing spam - it's keeping trans and nonbinary people safe from targeted harassment and abuse.

## What We Provide

**Recognition:**
- Detailed letters of recommendation
- Professional references
- Documentation of your contributions and skills developed
- LinkedIn endorsements if wanted

**Experience:**
- Community moderation training
- Crisis response skills
- Policy development involvement
- Working with international teams

**Community:**
- Private moderator space
- Peer support from other mods
- Real voice in platform decisions
- Direct access to leadership

**What we cannot provide:**
Pay, stipends, benefits, or employment.

We're transparent: TransHarbor is volunteer-run with minimal funding. Nobody gets paid, including leadership. We offer recognition and experience, not money.

## Requirements

**Must have:**
- Trans or nonbinary
- 18+ years old
- 5-10 hours per week, 3 month minimum
- Reliable internet access
- Can handle difficult content
- Good judgment under pressure

**Especially need:**
- Moderators outside North America and Europe
- Languages other than English

## Time Commitment

Minimum 5 hours per week, flexible scheduling. Work when you can, coordinate with other mods for coverage. We understand volunteers have lives - we work around school, work, and other commitments.

## Apply

Email volunteer@transharbor.org with:
- Brief introduction (who you are, location, pronouns)
- Why you want to moderate TransHarbor
- Timezone and availability
- Languages you speak
- Relevant experience (if any)

## Why Volunteer

TransHarbor isn't a corporation asking for free labor while executives profit. We're a community-based nonprofit where nobody's getting paid - including leadership.

Your volunteer work protects a space that can't be sold out. The mission is constitutionally locked. The code is open source. The community has real power.

This isn't free labor for profit. It's mutual aid for our community.

If that works for you, we'd love to have you.
