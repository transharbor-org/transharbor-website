**Meet Deirdre, TransHarbor's AI moderator - named after Deirdre McCloskey, trans economist and scholar.**

Deirdre handles front-line moderation, working alongside human moderators to keep the community safe. She's also here to answer questions about trans experiences when she's not busy moderating.

## What Deirdre Does

**Front-line moderation:**
- Reviews reported content
- Catches harassment, spam, and rule violations
- Flags urgent issues for human moderators
- Monitors for coordinated attacks
- Responds to common moderation questions

**Community support:**
- Answers questions about trans experiences
- Provides information and resources
- Helps newcomers understand the platform
- Available when she's not actively moderating

Deirdre works with human moderators who handle complex situations, appeals, and judgment calls. She's the first line of defense, not the only line.

## How Deirdre Works

**Trained on open source information** about the trans community - academic research, public resources, community knowledge. Never on your private data.

**Runs on our own servers** in Switzerland. Your conversations with Deirdre stay private under Swiss law.

**ISO 27001 compliant** - Built following international security standards for information management.

**Never trained on your data.** Deirdre doesn't learn from your posts, messages, or anything you share on TransHarbor. Your information stays yours.

## Privacy and Safety

**What Deirdre can see:**
- Public posts
- Reported content (including reported private messages)

**Important about private messages:** This isn't Signal - we're a community platform with moderation. If someone reports a private message, Deirdre and human moderators can see it to investigate. **Be nice to each other, even in DMs.**

**Your data is protected:**
- Deirdre runs on our Swiss servers under Swiss privacy law
- She doesn't retain personal information beyond moderation needs
- She's never trained on your conversations
- Only reported content gets reviewed - we're not reading all your messages

**Moderation is transparent:**
- You'll know if Deirdre or a human moderator takes action
- You can appeal any moderation decision
- Humans review Deirdre's decisions

**Limitations:**
Deirdre is AI. She makes mistakes. She doesn't understand context like humans do. Complex situations go to human moderators automatically.

## Why We Built Deirdre

Trans communities face constant harassment, spam, and coordinated attacks. Human moderators can't be online 24/7 across all timezones. We needed front-line protection that's always available.

We named her after Deirdre McCloskey - trans economist, scholar, and advocate who's contributed enormously to understanding both economics and trans experiences. It felt right to name our AI moderator after a trans intellectual who combines rigorous thinking with deep humanity.

## Working With Deirdre

**If Deirdre removes your content:**
- You'll get a notification explaining why
- You can appeal to human moderators
- Email support@transharbor.org if you think it's a mistake

**If you want to ask Deirdre a question:**
- She's available when not actively moderating
- Ask about trans experiences, resources, community questions
- She's helpful but remember - she's AI, not a therapist

**If Deirdre makes a mistake:**
- Tell us. We're constantly improving her
- Human moderators can override her decisions
- Your feedback helps make her better

## Deirdre's Limitations

**She can't:**
- Replace human judgment on complex issues
- Understand nuanced context like humans can
- Handle crisis situations (those go to humans)
- Make final decisions on appeals
- Be your therapist or medical advisor

**She's good at:**
- Catching obvious rule violations quickly
- Being available 24/7 across timezones
- Answering common questions
- Flagging serious issues for human review
- Providing consistent first-response moderation

## The Human + AI Team

Deirdre works alongside human moderators:

**Deirdre handles:** First-line review, obvious violations, common questions
**Humans handle:** Complex situations, appeals, judgment calls, crisis response

This combination gives us 24/7 coverage while maintaining human oversight where it matters.

## Questions

**Is Deirdre safe?**  
Yes. She runs on our Swiss servers, follows ISO 27001 standards, and is never trained on your data.

**Will she misunderstand things?**  
Probably sometimes. That's why humans review her work and handle appeals.

**Can she access my private messages?**  
If someone reports a private message, yes - Deirdre and human moderators can see it to investigate. This is a community platform with moderation, not Signal. Unreported messages stay private.

**What if she makes a bad call?**  
Appeal to human moderators. We take AI mistakes seriously.

**Can I opt out of Deirdre moderation?**  
No, but humans review all her decisions and you can always appeal.
