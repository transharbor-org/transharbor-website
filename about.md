**A community platform for trans and nonbinary people worldwide. Built by us, owned by us, protected forever.**

TransHarbor is a social platform where trans and nonbinary people can connect, organize, and build community - no matter where you are - without worrying about being sold out, shut down, or compromised.

## What Makes TransHarbor Different

**Mission-locked.** Our trans-centered purpose is constitutionally protected in Swiss law. It cannot be removed or changed. Ever.

**Community-owned.** No investors. No shareholders. No board that can sell us. The community votes on major decisions democratically.

**Actually safe.** Swiss servers, military-grade security, encrypted everything. Your data is protected by Swiss privacy law - strong constitutional privacy protections, no mandatory data retention, harder for governments to compel access.

**Open source.** All our code is public (AGPL-3.0). If we ever betray the mission, you can fork it and start over.

## How TransHarbor Works

**Everyone can:**
- Create a profile
- Make posts
- Send direct messages
- Participate in community discussions

**Voting Members can:**
- Submit proposals for platform changes
- Vote on community decisions
- Shape policies and guidelines
- Help govern the platform

**Becoming a Voting Member:**
You need to be active in the community: 3+ posts, account 60+ days old, and currently active. This ensures voting power stays with people invested in the community.

See [Community Guidelines](/guidelines) and [Voting Process](/voting) for details.

## Our Core Values

**Trans and nonbinary centered.** Everything we do serves trans and nonbinary communities. This isn't negotiable and can't be changed.

**Democratic governance.** Major decisions are made by voting members. The community has real power, not just the illusion of it.

**Safety first.** We protect you from harassment, doxxing, and data breaches. Security isn't optional.

**Privacy and data sovereignty.** Your data belongs to you. We don't sell it, mine it, or hand it over without a fight.

**Anti-discrimination.** We actively work against racism, ableism, and all forms of discrimination within trans and nonbinary spaces.

## The Technology

We built TransHarbor to be reliable and secure:

**Apps:** Flutter for iOS and Android (same codebase, consistent experience)

**Backend:** PocketBase with SQLite (lightweight, fast, self-hosted)

**Hosting:** Our own servers in Switzerland (not cloud, actual physical servers)

**Security:** Encrypted backups, hardware security modules, military-grade server hardening

**Code:** Open source (AGPL-3.0) - you can see exactly what we're running

## The Legal Structure

TransHarbor uses a dual-entity structure designed to protect the mission and your data globally:

**Swiss Association (Switzerland)** - Owns everything (code, trademark, infrastructure). Mission is constitutionally locked. Runs servers in Switzerland under Swiss privacy law - some of the strongest privacy protections in the world.

**Wyoming UNA (United States)** - Manages community, fundraises, handles day-to-day operations. Can be replaced if it compromises the mission.

**Why these jurisdictions?**
- **Switzerland**: Strong privacy law, constitutional protections, stable democracy, harder for any government to compel data access
- **Wyoming**: Simple nonprofit structure, minimal cost, allows democratic governance

This structure means:
- The mission can't be bought or sold
- Your data is protected under Swiss law regardless of where you live
- Even if we wanted to sell out, we legally can't
- The community has recourse if leadership goes bad
- Trans people worldwide benefit from Swiss privacy protections

Cost to maintain: $25/year. No investors. No shareholders.

## Current Status

**In Development** - Building the platform, setting up infrastructure, establishing governance.

**Join Early** - We're looking for community members to help shape TransHarbor before launch.

**Contribute** - Code is on GitHub. We welcome contributions.

## Why We Built This

Trans people everywhere are tired of losing our spaces.

Tired of platforms that start with good intentions and end with corporate buyouts.

Tired of choosing between "built by us but unsustainable" and "well-funded but will sell us out."

Tired of watching our communities get dispersed when platforms inevitably compromise.

Tired of governments - whether red states in the US, the UK's hostile policies, or transphobic regimes anywhere - having easy access to our data.

We wanted to build something that could last. Something where the mission is locked, the code is open, the governance is democratic, and trans people worldwide actually have power.

TransHarbor is that attempt.

## Get Involved
