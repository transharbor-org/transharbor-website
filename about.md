**A community platform for trans and nonbinary people worldwide. Built by us, for us, owned by us, protected forever.**

## How TransHarbor Works

**Everyone can:**
- Create a profile
- Make posts
- Send direct messages
- Participate in community discussions

**Voting Members can:**
- Submit proposals for platform changes
- Vote on community decisions
- Shape policies and guidelines
- Help govern the platform

**Becoming a Voting Member:**
You need to be active in the community: 3+ posts, account 60+ days old, and currently active. This ensures voting power stays with people invested in the community.

## Our Core Values

**Trans and nonbinary centered.** Everything we do serves trans and nonbinary communities. This isn't negotiable and can't be changed.

**Democratic governance.** Major decisions are made by voting members. The community has real power, not just the illusion of it.

**Safety first.** Security isn't optional. We provide government-grade security for your data.

**Privacy and data sovereignty.** Your data belongs to you. We don't sell it, mine it, or hand it over without a fight.

**Anti-discrimination.** We actively work against racism, ableism, and all forms of discrimination within trans and nonbinary spaces.

## Why We Built This

Trans people everywhere are tired of not having our own spaces.

Tired of TERFs and chasers.

Tired of being sold out.

Tired of watching our communities get dispersed when platforms inevitably compromise.

We wanted to build something that could last. Something where the mission is locked, the code is open, the governance is democratic, and trans people worldwide have all the power.

TransHarbor is that attempt.
