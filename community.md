**TransHarbor exists to serve trans and nonbinary people. These guidelines help us keep this space safe.**

By using TransHarbor, you agree to follow these guidelines and help protect our community.

## Core Principles

**Trans and nonbinary centered.** This platform is for us, by us. Trans and nonbinary experiences are centered here. We love allies, but this is a space for trans and nonbinary people.

**Safety first.** Zero tolerance for harassment, discrimination, doxxing, or threats. We protect each other.

**Respect everyone.** Use correct names and pronouns. Treat all trans identities with dignity. Welcome newcomers.

**Communicate constructively.** Be kind. Disagree respectfully. Listen. Practice empathy.

## What's Not Allowed

**Harassment and abuse** - Bullying, threats, targeted harassment, coordinated attacks

**Hate speech and discrimination** - Against trans people, nonbinary people, or based on race, disability, or other identities

**Doxxing** - Sharing personal information without consent (real names, addresses, phone numbers, workplaces)

**Sexual content** - Explicit sexual content, unsolicited sexual messages

**Spam and scams** - Advertising, scams, phishing, platform manipulation

**Impersonation** - Pretending to be someone else

**Platform abuse** - Creating multiple accounts to evade bans, vote manipulation, coordinated rule-breaking
