description: TransHarbor's community guidelines and core principles for keeping our trans and nonbinary space safe, respectful, and welcoming.
---

TransHarbor exists to serve trans and nonbinary people. These guidelines help keep this space safe.

## Core Principles

**Trans and nonbinary centered.** This platform is for us, by us. Trans and nonbinary experiences are centered here. Allies are welcome, but this is our space.

**Safety first.** Zero tolerance for harassment, discrimination, doxxing, or threats.

**Respect everyone.** Use correct names and pronouns. Treat all trans identities with dignity. Welcome newcomers.

**Communicate constructively.** Disagree respectfully. Listen. Practice empathy.

## Prohibited

**Harassment** - Bullying, threats, targeted harassment, coordinated attacks

**Hate speech** - Against trans people, nonbinary people, or based on race, disability, or other identities

**Doxxing** - Sharing personal information without consent (real names, addresses, phone numbers, workplaces)

**Sexual content** - Explicit sexual content, unsolicited sexual messages

**Spam** - Advertising, scams, phishing, platform manipulation

**Impersonation** - Pretending to be someone else

**Platform abuse** - Multiple accounts to evade bans, vote manipulation, coordinated rule-breaking

## Moderation

**Front-line:** Deirdre (our AI moderator) reviews reported content and flags violations. See [Meet Deirdre](/deirdre/) for details.

**Human review:** Trans community members review Deirdre's decisions and handle complex cases.

**We understand context.** Reclaiming slurs, venting about dysphoria, and community in-jokes are different from actual harassment. Our moderation team gets this.

## Enforcement

Violations result in:

1. **Warning** - First-time minor violations
2. **Content removal** - Posts or messages deleted
3. **Strike** - Recorded against your account (affects voting membership)
4. **Suspension** - 1-30 days depending on severity
5. **Permanent ban** - Severe or repeated violations

We may skip steps for severe violations like doxxing, threats, or coordinated harassment.

## Reporting

See something wrong? Report it.

Use the report button on posts or messages. Reports are confidential and reviewed promptly.

**Urgent safety issues:** Contact emergency services immediately.

## Appeals

Think we got it wrong? Email support@transharbor.org within 14 days. Include:

* Your username
* What happened
* Why you think it was incorrect

All appeals are reviewed by humans, not AI.

## Questions

Unclear about something? Ask at support@transharbor.org

We'd rather clarify than enforce.
