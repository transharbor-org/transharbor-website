# Security

TransHarbor provides enterprise-grade security for the trans and nonbinary community. Our community deserves the best protection available—and we've built our platform to deliver it.

## Enterprise Infrastructure

### Hardware Security Module (HSM)

We operate our own dedicated HSM with FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified hardware:
- Cryptographic keys stored in tamper-resistant hardware
- Secure certificate signing and encryption
- Hardware-backed authentication
- Private keys never leave the HSM

### Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

We operate our own complete PKI and Certificate Authority:
- Independent certificate issuance and management
- Complete control over encryption
- No third-party dependencies in our trust chain
- Enhanced privacy and security

### Data Protection

- TLS 1.3 for all connections
- AES-256 encryption for data at rest
- Encrypted database backups
- Self-hosted infrastructure (no cloud providers)
- Role-based access control
- Multi-factor authentication support

## Why This Matters

We've invested in enterprise-grade infrastructure because our community deserves the best protection available. Your safety is our priority.

## Open Source

Our code is open source for independent security audits and transparency.
