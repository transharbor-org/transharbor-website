# Security

TransHarbor provides enterprise-grade security for the trans and nonbinary community. We believe our community deserves the same level of security protection as major corporations—and we've built our platform to deliver it.

## Enterprise-Grade Security Infrastructure

### Hardware Security Module (HSM)

We operate our own dedicated Hardware Security Module to protect cryptographic keys and sensitive operations:

**Key Protection:**
- All cryptographic keys stored in tamper-resistant hardware
- Private keys never leave the HSM
- FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified hardware
- Physical and logical security controls

**Secure Operations:**
- Certificate signing
- Encryption key generation
- Password hash verification
- Authentication token generation

### Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

TransHarbor operates its own complete PKI, giving us full control over our security:

**Our Own Certificate Authority:**
- Independent certificate issuance and management
- No reliance on third-party certificate authorities for internal services
- Complete chain of trust under our control
- Regular certificate rotation and renewal

**What This Means:**
- We control every aspect of our encryption
- No external dependencies for critical security functions
- Enhanced privacy—no third parties in our trust chain
- Ability to issue certificates for all internal services

### Data Protection

**Encryption Everywhere:**
- TLS 1.3 for all connections
- AES-256 encryption for data at rest
- Encrypted database backups

**Access Control:**
- Hardware-backed authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Strict least-privilege policies

**Data Sovereignty:**
- All data stored on our own infrastructure
- No cloud providers with access to your data
- Complete control over data location and handling
- Self-hosted, self-managed infrastructure

## Why Enterprise Security Matters for Our Community

**Our Thoughts:**
We've invested in enterprise-grade infrastructure typically reserved for large corporations because our community deserves the best protection available. Your safety is our priority.

## Open Source Transparency

Our code is open source, allowing:
- Independent security audits
- Community review of security practices
- Transparency in implementation
- Collaborative security improvements
