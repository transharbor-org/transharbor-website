# Security

**Last Updated:** January 26, 2026

TransHarbor is committed to keeping your data safe and secure. As a community platform for trans and nonbinary people, we understand the critical importance of security and privacy.

## Security Practices

### Data Protection

**Encryption:**
- All data transmitted between your device and our servers is encrypted using TLS/SSL
- Passwords are hashed using industry-standard algorithms (never stored in plain text)
- Database backups are encrypted at rest

**Access Control:**
- Strict authentication and authorization controls
- Multi-factor authentication support (planned)
- Regular security audits of access logs

**Data Minimization:**
- We only collect data necessary to operate the platform
- No tracking pixels or third-party analytics
- Self-hosted infrastructure (no cloud providers with access to your data)

### Infrastructure Security

**Self-Hosted:**
- All services run on our own infrastructure
- No third-party cloud providers
- Full control over data storage and processing

**Regular Updates:**
- Security patches applied promptly
- Dependencies kept up-to-date
- Continuous monitoring for vulnerabilities

**Backups:**
- Encrypted daily backups
- Secure off-site storage
- Regular restoration testing

## Open Source

TransHarbor is open source, which means:
- Anyone can review our code for security issues
- Community security researchers can audit our practices
- Transparent security measures (no "security through obscurity")
