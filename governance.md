# Governance Structure

TransHarbor is a democratically-governed, user-owned nonprofit platform. This document explains how our community makes decisions together.

## Legal Foundation

### Wyoming Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (UNA)

TransHarbor operates as a Wyoming Unincorporated Nonprofit Association under Wyoming Statute §17-22-101 et seq. This structure provides:

- **No private ownership** - No shareholders, investors, or private owners
- **Nonprofit operation** - No profit distribution to individuals
- **Democratic governance** - Members participate in decision-making
- **Limited liability** - Members and organizers are protected from personal liability
- **Simplicity** - Minimal bureaucracy and regulatory burden
- **Flexibility** - Can evolve governance structures through member voting

### Key Characteristics

**Name:** TransHarbor Unincorporated Nonprofit Association

**Purpose:** Operating a user-owned, democratically-governed community platform for trans and nonbinary people to connect, communicate, and build community

**Formation Date:** [TBD]

**Registered Agent:** [TBD]

**EIN:** [TBD - To be obtained from IRS]

## Protected Principles

These core values can only be changed by supermajority vote (2/3 of voting members + 30% quorum):

### 1. Trans and Nonbinary Centered
This platform exists for and is governed by trans and nonbinary people. While allies may participate respectfully, the platform's focus, priorities, and decision-making must center trans and nonbinary experiences and needs.

### 2. User Ownership and Cooperative Governance
TransHarbor is owned collectively by its users, not by private individuals, corporations, or investors. Active members have a meaningful voice in how the platform operates through democratic processes.

### 3. Anti-Discrimination and Safety
Zero tolerance for harassment, hate speech, discrimination, or behavior that threatens community safety. Safety and respect are non-negotiable priorities.

### 4. Privacy and Data Sovereignty
User data belongs to users, not to TransHarbor, advertisers, or third parties. We will never sell user data or compromise privacy for profit. Privacy protections cannot be weakened without supermajority approval.

### 5. Democratic Decision-Making
Important platform decisions are made through transparent, democratic processes where voting members participate. Governance structures must remain democratic and accountable to the community.

## Organizer/Administrator Roles

### Bootstrap Phase (Until Democratic Structure Fully Operational)

During initial launch, a small organizing team manages:
- Technical infrastructure (hosting, deployment, updates)
- Critical security issues
- Emergency moderation (severe violations)
- Legal and financial compliance
- Implementation of passed proposals

**Organizing team:**
- [Names/roles TBD]
- Acts as stewards, not owners
- Subject to community oversight
- Committed to transitioning to democratic governance

### Long-Term Structure

As the platform grows, organizers become:
- **Implementers** of community decisions, not decision-makers

- **Technical stewards** maintaining infrastructure
- **Accountable** to voting members

**Powers:**
- Emergency actions (security, severe abuse) - reported to community

- Day-to-day moderation (within established guidelines)
- Financial management (transparently reported)

**Limitations:**
- Cannot change protected principles without supermajority vote

### Elections (Future)

When the platform reaches [TBD member count/milestone]:
- Organizer roles become elected positions

- Any voting member can run
- Elections conducted through platform
- Transition plan to be proposed and voted on by community

## Financial Governance

### Revenue Sources (Planned)

- **User donations** (voluntary, suggested amounts)

**Never:**
- Selling user data

- Investor funding that compromises autonomy

### Budget Transparency

### Spending Authority

**Without vote:**

- Escalate complex cases

### Accountability
