# Governance Structure

TransHarbor is a democratically-governed, user-owned nonprofit platform.

## Legal Foundation

### Wyoming Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (UNA)

TransHarbor operates as a Wyoming Unincorporated Nonprofit Association under Wyoming Statute §17-22-101 et seq.

## Protected Principles

### 1. Trans and Nonbinary Centered
