## How We Protect Trans and Nonbinary People

This page is about **safety** - how we protect you, your conversations, and your data from people who want to harm us.

## Why Safety Matters For Trans People

Let me be blunt: **we are targets.**

Trans people face:
- Doxxing (having your personal info exposed online)
- Organized harassment campaigns
- Hostile governments
- Data breaches that out people
- Platforms being forced to hand over user data
- Companies selling our information

A chat platform for trans and nonbinary people isn't just "an app." It's a list of who we are, what we talk about, who we know. **If we mess up your safety, real people get hurt.**

So we built our security infrastructure with one goal: **keep you safe.**

## How We Keep You Safe

### Your Data Can't Be Stolen (Physical Security Keys)

Imagine you have a diary with all your secrets. Most platforms keep that diary locked, but the key sits right next to it. If someone breaks into the room, they get both.

We use a **hardware security module** - think of it as a lock that can't be picked and a key that can't be copied. It's a physical device that:
- Lives in a secure location, like a bank vault
- Holds all the encryption keys
- **Cannot give out those keys, ever**
- Has to be physically present to unlock anything

**What this means for your safety:** Even if hackers completely break into our servers, they can't read your data. They'd have to then also physically break into a bank vault with guards and security measures to get the keys to unlock your data. Not a likely scenario.

This is the same tech and set of protocols that financial institutions use to keep your money safe and governments use to protect classified information. Except this time, we're using government-grade security standards to protect trans people from governments. There's something beautifully ironic about that.

### Our Servers Can't Be Easily Hacked (Military-Grade Security)

You know how your phone asks you to update all the time? And you probably ignore it?

We don't get to ignore that. Our servers follow **military security standards** - literally the same rules the US Department of Defense uses.

**What this means for your safety:**
- Security holes get patched quickly (before hackers can exploit them)
- Every door into the system is locked down and secured
- Every login is tracked (so we know if someone unauthorized gets in)
- The servers are configured for maximum protection

It's the difference between "we hoped for the best" and "we followed a 300-page security checklist designed to protect military secrets."

### Governments Can't Easily Get Your Data (Swiss Location)

Our servers are physically in Switzerland. Not Amazon's cloud. Not Google's servers. **Our actual servers in a Swiss datacenter.**

**What this means for your safety:**
- Hostile governments can't just demand your data
- Mass surveillance programs don't have easy access
- Swiss courts have to approve data requests (and they take privacy seriously)
- Swiss law protects your privacy constitutionally

The datacenter has guards, fingerprint access, cameras, backup power - the whole movie security setup.

**If someone wants your data, they can't just send a legal demand. They need a Swiss court order, which is much harder to get than in most countries.**

### Nobody Can Read Your Messages Without Permission (Encryption)

**Encryption** means scrambling data so only authorized people can read it. Like writing in a secret code.

**What this means for your safety:**
- Your messages are scrambled - only you and the person who you're talking to can read them
- The hard drives are scrambled - if someone steals the servers, they get gibberish
- Your internet connection is scrambled - nobody can spy on it
- Even the backups are scrambled

Without the keys (locked in that physical device in a bank vault), everything is just nonsense characters.

### ISO 27001 Compliant Infrastructure (Enterprise Security Standards)

We run on **Elastisys Welkin** - a Compliant Kubernetes platform designed to meet ISO 27001 standards.

**What is ISO 27001?** It's the international standard for information security management. Banks, hospitals, and government agencies use it.

**What this means for your safety:**

* We follow the same security standards as banks and hospitals
* Security controls, access management, and incident response are built into our infrastructure
* Everything is auditable and documented
* We can prove we're doing what we say

**Why Welkin?** Instead of building ISO 27001 compliance from scratch (which would take years and cost a lot), we use Welkin which provides enterprise-level security compliance designed for organizations that need strict security requirements.

Think of it like this: we're running bank-level security infrastructure for a community platform, because your safety deserves that level of protection.

### We Know If Someone Tries to Break In (Real-Time Monitoring)

We watch the servers 24/7 with automated systems that alert us if anything weird happens.

**What this means for your safety:**
- If someone tries to hack us, we know immediately (not days later)
- We can respond to attacks in real-time
- Suspicious activity gets investigated right away

Think of it like a security alarm - if someone tries to break in at 3am, we wake up and deal with it immediately.

### Your Data Can Be Recovered If Disaster Strikes (Tested Backups)

We regularly back everything up to a separate location.

**What this means for your safety:**
- If servers fail, your data isn't lost
- If we get hacked and data is destroyed, we can restore it
- If there's a fire or disaster, everything can be recovered

We actually test the backups to make sure they work. Because backups you haven't tested are just wishes.

## What Could Still Compromise Your Safety

I'm not going to lie to you. Here's what could still put you at risk:

**We might make a mistake.** Security is really hard. We might misconfigure something. We're human. We'll fix it fast if we catch it, but mistakes happen.

**New vulnerabilities get discovered constantly.** Software has bugs we don't know about yet. We update as fast as possible, but there's always a window of risk.

**Social engineering can bypass technical security.** If someone tricks one of us into doing something stupid, all our defenses won't help. We train against this, but humans are the weak link.

**Swiss courts can order data handover.** We'd fight it, but we might lose. The advantage is Swiss courts are much more protective of privacy than courts in most countries - it's harder for them to force us to hand over data.

**We're not a giant security company.** Signal has professional cryptographers and huge resources. We don't. We're doing the best we can with what we have.

**But here's the key thing: we're trying really hard to keep you safe.** And we're being honest about the risks instead of pretending they don't exist.

## Why Your Safety Matters This Much

Trans people deserve better than "eh, security is hard, we'll just wing it."

**You deserve to be safe.** Not "safe enough." Actually safe.

You deserve infrastructure built by people who understand that a data breach isn't just embarrassing - it's people getting outed, harassed, hurt, put in danger.

You deserve to have your conversations protected like they're classified government documents. Because **your safety is more important than classified documents.**

You deserve Swiss privacy law protecting your data because governments worldwide are increasingly hostile to trans people.

You deserve physical security devices protecting encryption keys because regular security can be hacked.

You deserve military-grade server protection because the people attacking trans platforms are sophisticated and organized.

You know what? **We deserve nice things.** And nice things include real safety, not just promises and hope.

## About Trusting Us With Your Safety

You're trusting people you don't know with your safety. That's a big ask.

Here's what I can promise:

**We'll be honest.** If something goes wrong, we'll tell you immediately. No hiding, no downplaying. Your safety depends on honesty.

**We'll fix problems fast.** Your safety comes before new features, always.

**We'll keep learning.** Keeping you safe isn't something you finish, it's something you practice every day.

**We'll be transparent.** Our security practices are documented openly so you can verify we're doing what we say.

What I can't promise:

**You'll never be at risk.** Nobody can promise that.

What I can promise is that we're building defenses to keep you as safe as we possibly can, and if something goes wrong, we'll tell you and fix it.

## Why We're Sharing This

Same reason we open sourced the legal structure: other trans platforms need this too.

Setting up this kind of safety infrastructure is hard. The guides are confusing. It seems impossible for small projects. To be honest, it often is.

We think we may have figured it out, at least for our community. We're sharing what we learned.

**Trans people deserve platforms that actually keep them safe.** Not because we have something to hide, but because we have everything to protect - ourselves, each other, our community.

## Final Thing

Building government-level security for trans people feels like:

- **Overkill** (it's just a chat app!)
- **Not enough** (what if someone still gets hurt?)
- **Exactly right** (trans people deserve to be safe)

I land on "exactly right."

Your safety deserves the best protection we can build. Your data deserves Swiss privacy law. Your conversations deserve military-grade security.

We're not perfect. We're not a huge security company. But we're trying really hard to keep you safe.

Come build it with us.

*PS: I know this page contains some technical language and concepts. Cybersecurity is inherently technical. But the core idea is simple: we use the same security that protects government secrets and bank money, because your safety deserves that level of protection. Questions? Ask - we're happy to explain more.*

*PPS: Some might think "this sounds paranoid." But after Grindr sold data, after Tumblr destroyed queer communities, after every trans space we've lost globally - is it really paranoid? We think it's just being realistic about the threats trans people face everywhere and doing something about it.*
